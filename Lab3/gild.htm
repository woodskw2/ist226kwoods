    <h3>We Keep You Afloat</h3>

    <p>Our GildPak system can handle almost any size shipment from small boxes to full container 
    loads. We handle all the details. We book your cargo, make the arrangements for 
    pick up and delivery, and we take care of all necessary paperwork. Our GPS  
    system uses RFID technology to keep track of where your cargo is at all times. We 
    will alert you if conditions change because of inclement weather at sea that might 
    result in a shipping delay. We handle all of the shipping requirements and documentation 
    for both the import and export countries; you don't have to worry about any of the 
    paperwork. We handle all the details from the smallest to the largest.</p>

    <h3>We Keep You on Time</h3>

    <p>Our fleet is comprised of both midsize and supersize vessels that can match the size 
    of your cargo and the degree to which you need your shipment expedited. You won't 
    pay extra for a service that you don't need. If you need your shipment expedited, 
    and assuming your cargo is capable of being transported by air, we can arrange for 
    an expedited delivery by combining sea cargo with air freight to produce a delivery 
    mechanism that is not cost prohibitive. Let the largest leg of your journey take 
    place at sea, and then call for expedited jet service once your cargo had been unloaded 
    at its port of call.</p>

    <h3>We Offer the Following Competitive Features</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Frequent and reliable cargo schedules from major Pacific and Indian Ocean 
      ports</li>
      <li>Advanced GPS cargo tracking</li>
      <li>Secure storage </li>
      <li>Unparalleled safety</li>
      <li>Port-to-Port or door-to-door service</li>
      <li>Alerts &ndash; should your cargo be delayed in transit for any reason</li>
