		<h3>Forget, Forgive, Follow</h3>
		<p><strong>Kroll Lumnstren</strong> continues the saga of Jacob aboard the Venture as he visits a galaxy never before visited by humans.

She must choose between her heritage, her being, and her love for Jacob. Her decision will affect not only her own life, but also Jacob's, who is in grave danger if Vena does not make the right choice. Does she choose with her heart or follow what she knows is the logical path?</p>
